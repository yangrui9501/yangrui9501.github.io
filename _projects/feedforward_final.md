This research report propose a feedback-feedforward control architecture for a 3-DoF nonlinear quadrotor model which the relative degree is not well-defined and the system subject to the parameter uncertainties. The simulation results reveals that the proposed controller is capable of tracking the desired trajectory in the presence of modeling uncertainties.
